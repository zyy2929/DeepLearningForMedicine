# DeepLearningForMedicine

We are two students at NYU CDS. This GitHub repository contains our final project for BMSC-GA 4493 Deep Learning in Medicine.

The pandemic Covid-19 has influenced all parts of our lives and we as young data scientists also want to contribute by doing this project. Many previous study has examined Chest X-Ray Images for Pneumonia Classification. Our goal here is to improve different CNN model performances and extend binary classification (normal/pneu.) to multi-class classification (normal/virus/bacteria).

The data we used come from a previous study (https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5) and all images can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

In our repository, the data folder contains our train-valid-test splitting information, for both 2 classes and 3 classes. The code folder contains all python code and visualizations that leads to our results. The report folder includes our presentation and paper (still working on it, please come back later).
