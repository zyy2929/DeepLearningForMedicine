# DeepLearningForMedicine

We are two students at NYU CDS. This GitHub repository contains our final project for BMSC-GA 4493 Deep Learning in Medicine.

The pandemic Covid-19 has influenced all parts of our lives and we as young data scientists also want to contribute by doing this project. Many previous study has examined Chest X-Ray Images for Pneumonia Classification. Our goal here is to improve different CNN model performances and extend binary classification (normal/pneu.) to multi-class classification (normal/virus/bacteria).

The data we used come from a previous study (https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5) and all images can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

In our repository, the data folder contains our train-valid-test splitting information, for both 2 classes and 3 classes. The code folder contains all python code and visualizations that leads to our results. The report folder includes our presentation and paper.

After hyperparameter tuning, We decided to use learning rate=0.001, and optimizer=Adam in all models.
